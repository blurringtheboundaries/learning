# line of code example
<details>
  <summary>const synth = new Tone.PolySynth()</summary>
- In this line we define an object called synth. This could be called anything: elephant, banana, etc. as long as it makes sense to us. The name should start with a lower case letter.
- We use the word constant to tell JavaScript that we will not use the word synth for anything else. It will always be the same synth as long as the program is running
- The word new tells JavaScript to create a new object. We use Tone with a capital T to refer to the Tone library. After the dot, we type the name of the type of object we want to create
- The tone library contains a type of object called PolySynth (capital P and S). This is followed by parentheses, which we can fill with parameters in future explorations.
