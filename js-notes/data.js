// we can define a data structure in JavaScript using curly brackets
// the next line of code contains two entries called mood and temperature. each entry is separated by a comma.
var example = {'mood':'good', 'temperature':'hot'}

// the format for storing data is: the name of the entry in quotes, followed by a colon, followed by the information, and then a comma

// we can access an item from the array using square brackets and the number of the item, like so: 
console.log(example['mood'])

// modify the line of code above to print the temperature.

// uncomment the line of code below to set the temperature to 'cold'
// example['temperature'] = 'cold'
