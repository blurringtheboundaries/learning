# JavaScript notes

Here are some quick notes for JavaScript, written for use with a screen reader in conversation with Jason Dasent.

The examples are intended to be run in Node from the terminal in Visual Studio Code, which is currently our preferred editor for use with VoiceOver on the Mac.

For example:

`node arrays.js`

Some examples have comments with suggestions to modify or un-comment certain areas.

These are currently meant for our internal use and there may be errors alongside access issues. We are making the source available for now as we bring our resources online.

Notes from a previous JavaScript session (August 2021) can be found [here](https://blurringtheboundaries.github.io/learning/tone/).
