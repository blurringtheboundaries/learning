// an array is a collection of items enclosed by square brackets
// each item in an array is separated by a comma
// the next line of code defines an array called test. the array contains three items.
var test = ['hello', 'world','testing'];

// you can use a number to access an item in the array. start counting from zero.
// so in the array called test, item 0 is 'hello', item 1 is 'world', item 2 is 'testing'
// we can access an item from the array using square brackets and the number of the item, like so: 
// test[0]


//modify the code below to get the console to print 'testing' 
console.log(test[0])
console.log(test[1])
